.
.SH "Installation"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you have ruby installed:
.
.IP
gem install gist
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you\'re using Bundler:
.

.IP "" 0
.
.SH "Command"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
To upload the contents of \fBa\.rb\fR just:

.IP
gist a\.rb
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Upload multiple files:
.
.IP
gist a b c gist *\.rb
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
By default it reads from STDIN, and you can set a filename with \fB\-f\fR\.
.
.IP
gist \-f test\.rb <a\.rb
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Alternatively, you can just paste from the clipboard:
.
.IP
gist \-P
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Use \fB\-p\fR to make the gist private:
.
.IP
gist \-p a\.rb
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Use \fB\-d\fR to add a description:
.
.IP
gist \-d "Random rbx bug" a\.rb
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
You can update existing gists with \fB\-u\fR:
.
.IP
gist \-u GIST_ID FILE_NAME gist \-u 42f2c239d2eb57299408 test\.txt
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you\'d like to copy the resulting URL to your clipboard, use \fB\-c\fR\.
.
.IP
gist \-c <a\.rb
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you\'d like to copy the resulting embeddable URL to your clipboard, use \fB\-e\fR\.
.
.IP
gist \-e <a\.rb
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
And you can just ask gist to open a browser window directly with \fB\-o\fR\.
.
.IP
gist \-o <a\.rb
.
.IP "\(bu" 4

.
.SH "Login"
Before you use \fBgist\fR for the first time you will need to log in\. There are two supported login flows:
.
.IP "1." 4
The Github device\-code Oauth flow\. This is the default for authenticating to github\.com, and can be enabled for Github Enterprise by creating an Oauth app, and exporting the environment variable \fBGIST_CLIENT_ID\fR with the client id of the Oauth app\.
.
.IP "2." 4
The (deprecated) username and password token exchange flow\. This is the default for GitHub Enterprise, and can be used to log into github\.com by exporting the environment variable \fBGIST_USE_USERNAME_AND_PASSWORD\fR\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "The device\-code flow"
This flow allows you to obtain a token by logging into GitHub in the browser and typing a verification code\. This is the preferred mechanism\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

gist \-\-login
Requesting login parameters\.\.\.
Please sign in at https://github\.com/login/device
  and enter code: XXXX\-XXXX
Success! https://github\.com/settings/connections/applications/4f7ec0d4eab38e74384e
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The returned access_token is stored in \fB~/\.gist\fR and used for all future gisting\. If you need to you can revoke access from https://github\.com/settings/connections/applications/4f7ec0d4eab38e74384e\.
.
.SS "The username\-password flow"
This flow asks for your GitHub username and password (and 2FA code), and exchanges them for a token with the "gist" permission (your username and password are not stored)\. This mechanism is deprecated by GitHub, but may still work with GitHub Enterprise\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

gist \-\-login
Obtaining OAuth2 access_token from GitHub\.
GitHub username: ConradIrwin
GitHub password:
2\-factor auth code:
Success! https://github\.com/settings/tokens
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
This token is stored in \fB~/\.gist\fR and used for all future gisting\. If you need to you can revoke it from https://github\.com/settings/tokens, or just delete the file\.
.
.P
If you have a complicated authorization requirement you can manually create a token file by pasting a GitHub token with \fBgist\fR scope (and maybe the \fBuser:email\fR for GitHub Enterprise) into a file called \fB~/\.gist\fR\. You can create one from https://github\.com/settings/tokens
.
.P
This file should contain only the token (~40 hex characters), and to make it easier to edit, can optionally have a final newline (\fB\en\fR or \fB\er\en\fR)\.
.
.P
For example, one way to create this file would be to run:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

(umask 0077 && echo MY_SECRET_TOKEN > ~/\.gist)
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The \fBumask\fR ensures that the file is only accessible from your user account\.
.
.SS "GitHub Enterprise"
If you\'d like \fBgist\fR to use your locally installed GitHub Enterprise \fIhttps://enterprise\.github\.com/\fR, you need to export the \fBGITHUB_URL\fR environment variable (usually done in your \fB~/\.bashrc\fR)\.
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

export GITHUB_URL=http://github\.internal\.example\.com/
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Once you\'ve done this and restarted your terminal (or run \fBsource ~/\.bashrc\fR), gist will automatically use GitHub Enterprise instead of the public github\.com
.
.P
Your token for GitHub Enterprise will be stored in \fB\.gist\.<protocol>\.<server\.name>[\.<port>]\fR (e\.g\. \fB~/\.gist\.http\.github\.internal\.example\.com\fR for the GITHUB_URL example above) instead of \fB~/\.gist\fR\.
.
.P
If you have multiple servers or use Enterprise and public GitHub often, you can work around this by creating scripts that set the env var and then run \fBgist\fR\. Keep in mind that to use the public GitHub you must unset the env var\. Just setting it to the public URL will not work\. Use \fBunset GITHUB_URL\fR
.
.SS "Token file format"
If you cannot use passwords, as most Enterprise installations do, you can generate the token via the web interface and then simply save the string in the correct file\. Avoid line breaks or you might see: \fB$ gist \-l Error: Bad credentials\fR
.
.TP
You can also use Gist as a library from inside your ruby code:
.
.IP
Gist\.gist("Look\.at(:my => \'awesome\')\.code")
.
.P
If you need more advanced features you can also pass:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB:access_token\fR to authenticate using OAuth2 (default is `File\.read("~/\.gist"))\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB:filename\fR to change the syntax highlighting (default is \fBa\.rb\fR)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB:public\fR if you want your gist to have a guessable url\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB:description\fR to add a description to your gist\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB:update\fR to update an existing gist (can be a URL or an id)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB:copy\fR to copy the resulting URL to the clipboard (default is false)\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fB:open\fR to open the resulting URL in a browser (default is false)\.
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
NOTE: The access_token must have the \fBgist\fR scope and may also require the \fBuser:email\fR scope\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you want to upload multiple files in the same gist, you can:
.
.IP
Gist\.multi_gist("a\.rb" => "Foo\.bar", "a\.py" => "Foo\.bar")
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you\'d rather use gist\'s builtin access_token, then you can force the user to obtain one by calling:
.
.IP
Gist\.login!
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
This will take them through the process of obtaining an OAuth2 token, and storing it in \fB~/\.gist\fR, where it can later be read by \fBGist\.gist\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "Configuration"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you\'d like \fB\-o\fR or \fB\-c\fR to be the default when you use the gist executable, add an alias to your \fB~/\.bashrc\fR (or equivalent)\. For example:
.
.IP
alias gist=\'gist \-c\'
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
If you\'d prefer gist to open a different browser, then you can export the BROWSER environment variable:
.
.IP
export BROWSER=google\-chrome
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If clipboard or browser integration don\'t work on your platform, please file a bug or (more ideally) a pull request\.
.
.P
If you need to use an HTTP proxy to access the internet, export the \fBHTTP_PROXY\fR or \fBhttp_proxy\fR environment variable and gist will use it\.
.
